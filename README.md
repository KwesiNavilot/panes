# Pope Atona Navilot Encryption Scheme
This software is a cryptographic scheme that implements an algorithm that uses a modified version of the Caesar cypher in encrypting and decrypting texts and files. The scheme, PANES, builds upon Caesarâ€™s encryption scheme by converting texts, through their numerical values, into SYMBOLS and CHARACTERS after applying a shift in the reverse order of negative two (-2).
