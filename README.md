#Pope Atona Navilot Encryption Scheme
This software is an encryption that implements an algorithm that uses a modified version of the Caesar cypher in encrypting and decrypting texts and plain text files. The algorithm, PAN Encryption Standard, builds upon Caesarâ€™s encryption scheme by converting texts, through their numerical values, into SYMBOLS and characters after applying a shift in the reverse order of negative two (-2).
